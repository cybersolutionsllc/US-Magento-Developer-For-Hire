Looking to hire a Magento Developer? Your search ends here ..

Hi my name is Brian Wade I'm a US Magento Developer and I've been working with Magento exclusively since 2017. I've worked with Magento 1 and 2 - Community Edition and Enterprise Edition extensively and I know Magento intimately. Over time the need for my services has grown and so my business has evolved into a Magento Development company composed over over 20+ team members of various Magento strengths. Here's why you should start working with us today ...

Easy Communication - English is my first language and our team members all speak fluent English. We would not subject you to sub-standard communication where direction or correspondence can get mis understood. Additionally all of our existing clients enjoy the fact that they have access to my calendar and can schedule a call with me directly in order to discuss anything over the phone.

Safety - Let's face it hiring online can be scary when you can't speak to someone face to face. Additionally, 3rd world Magento Developers might not be who they say they are or use very "lax" security practices. If you hire the "wrong" developer they may use access to install malware and credit card siphoning programming on your Magento store front. My identify is verified and I've been a trusted member of the Magento community for over 8 years. I can also provide many references for my work which is publically visible on a 3rd party site which I don't have control over.

Professional Development Process - We utilize GIT versioning during our development to track history changes. This also allows management to see what code changes are taking place at any moment. In our system we utilize a comprehensive work flow which includes: Project Management (Investigation and clarification), Development process, Quality Assurance review, a Code Review, and Deployment to your production site. With this work flow we can identify and address bugs and issues before they make it to your production site.

If everything you've read has been music to your ears, and you'd like to see what it's like to work with some of the best US Magento Developers - please navigate to our website or give us a call and schedule a time for an introduction chat!

You'll be glad you did.
